## What is Swagger?

Swagger is an open source set of rules, specifications and tools for developing and describing RESTful APIs. The Swagger framework allows developers to create interactive, machine and human-readable API documentation.

API specifications typically include information such as supported operations, parameters and outputs, authorization requirements, available endpoints and licenses needed. Swagger can generate this information automatically from the source code by asking the API to return a documentation file from its annotations.
